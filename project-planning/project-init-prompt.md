# Agentic GitHub Issue Response System - Project Initialization

## Project Overview

I want to build an intelligent agentic system that automatically responds to GitHub issues by leveraging AI-powered code analysis and generation. Here's how the system should work:

### Core Concept

- **GitHub Webhook Listener**: A FastAPI HTTP server running on port 8080 that receives webhook notifications when new issues are created in GitHub repositories
- **AI-Powered Processing**: Uses the `claude code` CLI tool to analyze issues and generate appropriate responses, solutions, or code changes
- **Long-Running Job Management**: Handles potentially long-running LLM workloads with proper monitoring and status tracking
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Each issue gets processed in its own isolated environment using git worktree to create unique branches
- **Automated Updates**: System automatically updates the GitHub issue with progress, results, or generated solutions

### Technical Architecture

- **HTTP Server**: FastAPI-based webhook receiver listening on port 8080
- **Git Management**: Uses `git worktree` to create isolated branches for each issue (`issue-{issue_number}`)
- **CLI Integration**: Leverages `claude code` CLI tool for AI-powered code analysis and generation
- **Job Monitoring**: Tracks long-running processes and ensures completion before updating GitHub
- **Webhook Processing**: Handles GitHub webhook payloads and extracts issue information

### Development Approach

- **Phase 1**: Build and test within this repository using local webhook testing
- **Phase 2**: Expand to handle requests from external repositories with proper authentication and security
- **Sandboxing**: Each issue processing happens in isolated directories to prevent conflicts

## Project Setup Request

Please help me set up the foundational structure for this project. I need:

### 1. Directory Structure

Create a well-organized project structure with these specific directories:

```
agent/
├── project-planning/     # Project documentation, specs, and planning docs
├── research/            # Research materials, references, and investigation notes
├── tasks/              # Task management and communication
│   ├── users/          # User-facing task communications
│   └── agents/         # Agent-to-agent task communications
├── src/                # Main application source code
│   ├── api/            # FastAPI application and routes
│   ├── core/           # Core business logic
│   ├── models/         # Data models and schemas
│   ├── services/       # Service layer (GitHub, CLI integration)
│   └── utils/          # Utility functions and helpers
├── config/             # Configuration files
├── tests/              # Test suite
└── scripts/            # Utility scripts and automation
```

### 2. FastAPI Application

Set up a basic FastAPI server with:

- **Webhook endpoint**: `POST /webhook/github` to receive GitHub issue webhooks
- **Health check**: `GET /health` for monitoring
- **Status endpoint**: `GET /jobs/{job_id}` to check job status
- **Basic request/response models** for webhook payloads
- **CORS configuration** for development
- **Logging setup** for debugging and monitoring

### 3. Initial Configuration

- **Environment configuration** using `.env` files
- **GitHub webhook secret validation**
- **Basic CLI tool integration setup**
- **Git worktree management utilities**

### 4. Development Dependencies

Include necessary dependencies for:

- FastAPI and uvicorn
- Pydantic for data validation
- Requests for HTTP client operations
- GitPython for git operations
- python-dotenv for environment management
- Logging and monitoring tools

### 5. Basic Project Files

- **README.md**: Project overview and setup instructions
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies
- **.env.example**: Environment variables template
- **.gitignore**: Appropriate ignore patterns
- **main.py**: Application entry point

## Next Steps

After the basic structure is created, we'll need to:

1. Implement GitHub webhook signature validation
2. Build the job queue and monitoring system
3. Integrate with `claude code` CLI tool
4. Create git worktree management logic
5. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
6. Build the GitHub API integration for issue updates

Please create this foundational structure and get the basic FastAPI server running so we can start building the core functionality.
