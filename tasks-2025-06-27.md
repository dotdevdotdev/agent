# Tasks for 2025-06-27

## System Reliability and Maintenance

### Priority 1: Fix Critical Bug ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH
- **Issue**: `src/services/event_router.py:712` calls non-existent `job_manager.mark_job_completed()` method
- **Solution**: Replace with proper `update_job_status(job_id, "completed", result=...)` method
- **Impact**: Prevents job completion tracking failures
- **Status**: Pending

### Priority 2: Investigate Job Duplication üîç MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Job history shows duplicate entries with same job_id but different completion times
- **Analysis Needed**: 
  - Check for race conditions in job status updates
  - Review job completion workflow
  - Identify root cause of duplication
- **Impact**: Data integrity and accurate job tracking
- **Status**: Pending

### Priority 3: System Cleanup üßπ MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Multiple old worktree directories from previous jobs
- **Tasks**:
  - Clean up existing old worktrees
  - Review automated cleanup scheduling
  - Implement better cleanup mechanisms
- **Impact**: Disk space management and system hygiene
- **Status**: Pending

### Priority 4: Enhanced Testing üß™ MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Complex state machine and error recovery flows need more comprehensive testing
- **Tasks**:
  - ‚úÖ Add comprehensive tests for agent state machine (test_agent_state_machine.py)
  - ‚úÖ Add comprehensive tests for error classification and recovery (test_error_recovery.py)
  - ‚úÖ Add comprehensive tests for event routing system (test_event_router.py)
  - ‚è≥ Verify tests run correctly and provide good coverage
- **Impact**: System reliability and confidence in deployments
- **Status**: In Progress - Major test coverage additions completed

### Priority 5: PostgreSQL Migration üóÑÔ∏è LOW
- **Issue**: Currently using file-based storage (job_history.json) but has PostgreSQL config ready
- **Benefit**: Improved reliability and concurrency for production
- **Impact**: Production readiness
- **Status**: Future consideration

## Discovered During Analysis
- System is Phase 2 completed with sophisticated features
- Recent activity shows proper boundary testing (refusing non-coding tasks)
- Admin validation and error handling working correctly
- Code quality is high with comprehensive error handling
- Production-ready features already implemented

## Notes
- Focus on reliability over new features
- System is impressively sophisticated and well-architected
- Recent commits show active development and debugging
- Validation system working well with admin overrides
