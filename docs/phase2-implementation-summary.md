## 📊 Key Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Issue Understanding
```python
# Automatically parses GitHub issue templates
parsed_task = issue_parser.parse_issue(issue_body, issue_title)
# → TaskType.CODE_ANALYSIS, TaskPriority.HIGH, complexity="Medium"

# Validates completeness with detailed feedback
validation_result = task_validator.validate_task_completeness(parsed_task)
# → completeness_score: 85/100, suggestions: ["Add more context"]
```

### 2. Rich State Management
```python
# Seamless state transitions with GitHub integration
await state_machine.transition_to(job_id, AgentState.IMPLEMENTING, 
    user_message="Beginning implementation of the solution...")
# → Updates GitHub labels, creates progress comments
```

### 3. Multi-Event Processing
```python
# Intelligent event routing
result = await event_router.route_event("issue_comment", payload)
# → Routes to CommentEventProcessor, analyzes intent, updates conversation
```

### 4. Conversation Memory
```python
# Context-aware responses
response = await response_generator.generate_progress_update(
    conversation_id, current_state, progress_details)
# → Personalized based on user preferences and conversation history
```

### 5. Error Recovery
```python
# Automatic error handling with recovery
success = await recovery_manager.handle_error(job_id, error, context)
# → Classifies error, attempts recovery, escalates if needed
```
